        <h2>Chef John's American Goulash</h2>
        American goulash was one of my all-time favorite comfort food meals when I was growing up. They served it in my school cafeteria alongside a slice of buttered white bread and a carton of milk. This Americanized version of goulash was invented to stretch a small amount of beef into enough food for a not-so-small family. It's a simple dish that doesn't taste simple, so it's perfect for your weeknight dinner rotation.
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 large bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Hungarian paprika</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 quart chicken broth or water</li>
            <li>1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 cups elbow macaroni</li>
            <li> Â¼ cup chopped Italian parsley</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded white Cheddar cheese (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
            Gather all ingredients. 
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and onion; cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook and stir until liquid is evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic, bay leaves, paprika, Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, and cayenne.
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            Cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors come together, about 3 minutes. Pour in broth, marinara sauce, and diced tomatoes. Pour water into the sauce jar, swirl, and pour into the pot. Stir in soy sauce; bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until flavors intensify, about 30 minutes. 
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a rapid simmer. Stir in macaroni; cook, stirring occasionally, until just barely tender, about 12 minutes. Check for doneness after 10 minutes. 
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            Remove from the heat and discard bay leaves. Stir in Cheddar and parsley. Cover and let rest for 5 minutes. Taste and season as desired.
